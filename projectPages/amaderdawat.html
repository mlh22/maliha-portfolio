        <h2 class="display-3">Organizer Role</h2>
        <div class="content-text-box">
            <p>
                As a lead organizer of Amader Dawat (transl: "Our Gathering") I contributed heavily to conversations surrounding event 
                planning and strategies. In addition to planning fundraising and community events alongside a small team of other organizers, 
                I primarily spearheaded the social media marketing and brand content. This meant evolving Amader Dawat's existing brand 
                identity to a more sophisticated and consistent style, managing communications through Instagram, and creating eye-catching 
                graphics to promote Amader Dawat's efforts. Joining the team at such an early stage of this organization's existence and
                after a brief hiatus from the founding organizers, I was facing the challenge of building momentum after months of sparse 
                activity for programming with which I had vey little familiarity.

            <p>
                In an effort to create more consistent branding that could be carried forward even without my direct contribution to 
                marketing, I first had to establish a visual identity. I created a visual identity whiteboard, which held the primary 
                purpose of very clearly communicating visual styling and hierarchy as knowledge that could passed forward long after my 
                volunteership. This whiteboard features fonts used for styling header and paragraph content, recurring 
                graphics for specific events, an array of colors used for general social media posts and promoting monthly programming, 
                and an array of post backgrounds serving as example for marketing larger events. Using this board, I could quickly 
                reference significant design elements and piece together a cohesive visual identity.

        <h2 class="display-3">Marketing Impact</h2>
        <div class="content-text-box">
            <p>
                Amader Dawat's main focus is on community building through event programming, so the majority of social media content 
                involves promotion of different-sized events. These events draw in the common audience of queer Bengali folks, though 
                some events are specified to be closed to the community or open to allies. Amader Dawat aims to create an intergenerational 
                safe space for queer Bengali creators and artists to be celebrated and find support within the community.
                <div class="background-box">
                    <h3>Signature Events</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amader Robibar (Our Sunday), a small event recurring monthly to bring LGBTQ+ Bengali folks in NYC together 
                            in one room to share personal experiences and provide resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pohela Boishakh (Bengali New Year), Amader Dawat's flagship event to celebrate Bengali culture and uplift 
                            artists within the community
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Within my first month of joining as an organizer, Amader Dawat's social media has had a 350% increase in profile activity and 
                a 700% increase in reaching new accounts. In total my fundraising efforts have led to more than $7000 in community donations.

            <h3>Open Mic Teaser</h3>
            <div class="col-7 col-sm-7 col-md-5 col-lg-5 mx-auto align-self-center">
                <p>
                    One of the first large events I worked on marketing for was a community open mic, with a featured drag performer, 
                    resources provided by various other grassroots organizations, and audiovisual equipment for anyone to share their art. 
                    This event was to serve as a soft-launch fundraiser to build momentum for Amader Dawat and raise money for a large event 
                    due to take place mid-2026. However, due to limited volunteer 
                    capacity and budgeting concerns, details for the event would be finalized last minute. Therefore, to build hype for 
                    the event with this significant delay, I created a teaser trailer. The trailer was created in a way to excite 
                    audiences for what's to come without commitment to a set time and location, offering just enough details to support 
                    marketing when event specifications were not yet finalized.

        <h2 class="display-3">Reflections</h2>
        <div class="content-text-box">
            <p>There is still plenty of work to be done as Amader Dawat is still a small organization at the beginning stages of their 
                activism. As a queer Bengali person myself, I find this to be such a valuable volunteer experience, and I wish this 
                organization existed while I was growing up. Through our efforts, we hope to connect our 
                queer elders, motivate young adult audiences, and provide inspiration for queer Bengali youth today.
