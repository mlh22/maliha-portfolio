            <h3 class="display-5">Associate Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                I was a full time full stack software engineer working within the Commercial and Investment Banking (CIB) line of 
                business. In this role, I maintained an internal application used for record storage and audit history. This involved 
                significant programming work in Java Spring Boot and ReactJS. I wrote and tested APIs, prototyped and developed front-end 
                UI changes, and communicated to clients about new features and business requirement. This work is confidential and cannot 
                be displayed on my own portfolio; however, I am grateful for the experience my almost-three years in financial technology 
                provided me. Through my role I gained significant experience prototyping in Figma and coding these prototypes using various 
                Javascript libraries. I learned to become more accessibility-minded in my designs as well, accounting for things such as 
                visual contrast, light and dark modes, keyboard navigation for screen elements, etc.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="display-5">Activism Work</h3>
            <p>
                Though I was on JPMC's payroll primarily as an associate engineer on the record storage project, I have had many more 
                contributions to (and through) the company. Through JPMorgan's Force for Good initiative, I was able to work directly 
                with the Ali Forney Center, a nonprofit organization based in NYC providing shelter and resources for unhoused queer 
                youth, to get them a CRM platform to facilitate their business operations. In addition, I was lucky to have 
                a manager who was a significant player in the firm's DEI initiatives, particularly through a business resource group called 
                Pride at Work. Through this group, I had the opportunity to speak in panels about my lived experience as a queer nonbinary 
                person working in a corporate environment. In addition, I spearheaded an initiative within my particular line of business, 
                leading a group of like-minded individuals to develop programming and initiatives towards promoting DEI practices within JPMC.

            <p>
                This was my first job opportunity post my undergraduate education, and I am forever grateful to the connections I made 
                and the ways in which I have learned about myself as a laborer and as a person. It was through this role that I recognized 
                I have many skills to offer, and that my heart lies in more creative roles. I found myself thriving in assignments involving 
                a heavier focus on UI/UX, and felt incredibly fulfilled through my volunteering opportunities on the side as well.
